## Research 
My research is about the intersection between emotions and cards suits. 

5 Insights: 

1. Hearts are ascociated with love, clubs lower class, spades to valour and bravery, diamonds represent upper class.
2. Cards in digital games translate emotion by for example: A King card that pulses and slightly trembles when the player is “under pressure” → conveys anxiety.
3. Playing aggressive card games made people feel less negative emotions (like fear or restlessness) and more positive emotions (like excitement or interest) as per Frontiers (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1505360/

4. The same card can make people feel very different things, but some feelings still repeat across the group

5. People use embodied, connecting gestures (like a hug for example) to resolve emotional opposites.

6. Cards can be associated to emotions in matrixes

7. Playing cards aren’t just for games, they can also be used as symbols, where each suit and rank connects to different emotions, opposites, and journeys, helping to make feelings easier to see and understand.

- **Instalation Idea:**
When families enter the installation, they are greeted by a spinning wheel of cards, sparking curiosity and anticipation. One person draws a card representing an emotion—like togetherness—and expresses it through a simple gesture, such as holding hands or sharing a hug. As they do, the card on the screen comes alive, flipping to reveal its suit along with its story and historical meaning. The card then drops into one of four glowing circles, each representing a different suit, which light up and grow brighter as more cards are added. With immersive sound and light guiding the experience, participants embark on a playful, shared journey through all four suits, discovering both the power of emotions and the rich history behind each card.
